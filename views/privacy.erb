<h2>What We Collect</h2>

<p>
  When you log in, your call sign and basic profile info are stored on our servers.
  Your net activity (monitoring, chat messages, reactions, and favorites) is stored
  on our servers and visible to other logged-in users.
</p>

<p>
  If you enable push notifications, your device token is stored on our servers and
  deleted when you log out.
</p>

<p>
  The App uses <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Firebase Analytics</a>
  to collect anonymized usage data (screen views and in-app actions). No call sign or
  credentials are included in analytics events.
</p>

<p>
  Check-in location data (grid square, city, state, coordinates) originates from
  NetLogger and is displayed as-is. We do not collect your device's GPS location.
